# Preface

**Arduino Full Stack** is an open source book entirely written by [NanJing Longer Vision Robot Technology Ltd.](http://www.longervisionrobot.com). In this book, over 50 examples are to be discussed for the Arduino applications. You will get familiar with:

* Basic concepts on what Arduino is
* 40 fundamental sensors by around 40 examples
* DC motor, stepper motor, servor motor, etc., with several examples
* Some other advanced sensors, including camera, 9-DOF Gyro, etc.
* And our target of this book is to finally build an Arduino based race car, namely, an Mini-size Autonomous Vehicle with selected sensors.

The book is put on gitbook at: [https://longervision.gitbooks.io/arduino-full-stack/](https://longervision.gitbooks.io/arduino-full-stack/), and all source code is tested and put on github at: [https://github.com/LongerVision/Arduino](https://github.com/LongerVision/Arduino) .
